                    <p>Mercury, the swift planet, is the smallest in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. Its heavily cratered surface, reminiscent of our Moon, tells a story of intense bombardment. This proximity leads to extreme temperature variations, making it a world of fire and ice.</p>
                    <p>Unlike many other planets, Mercury possesses a surprisingly large iron core, which accounts for a significant portion of its volume.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3 class="afterimage">A Planet of Extremes: Size, Orbit, and Temperature</h3>
            <p class="afterimage">This dense core and a weak magnetic field continue to puzzle scientists, driving further exploration and research. Mercury is significantly smaller than Earth, with a diameter of only about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles). This is only about 38% of Earth's diameter, making it only slightly larger than our Moon. Its proximity to the Sun is what truly defines Mercury. It orbits our star at an average distance of only 57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles), completing a full orbit in just 88 Earth days â€“ a remarkably short year.</p>

            <h3 class="afterimage">A Surface Sculpted by Impacts and Ancient Volcanoes</h3>
            <p class="afterimage">Mercury's surface is heavily cratered, bearing a striking resemblance to the Moon. These craters are the result of countless impacts from asteroids and comets over billions of years. One of the most prominent features is the Caloris Basin, a massive impact crater spanning approximately 1,550 kilometers (960 miles) in diameter. The impact that created this basin was so powerful that it sent seismic waves reverberating around the planet, creating a region of jumbled terrain known as "weird terrain" on the opposite side. In addition to craters, Mercury also features smooth plains, believed to have been formed by ancient volcanic activity. These plains likely arose from lava flows that covered older, more heavily cratered regions.</p>

            <h3 class="after">A Surprisingly Strong Magnetic Field and a Thin Exosphere</h3>
            <p class="after">One of the most unexpected discoveries about Mercury was the presence of a magnetic field. This was surprising because scientists thought that a planet as small as Mercury, with its slow rotation, shouldn't have one. Mercury's magnetic field is only about 1% as strong as Earth's, but its existence is still a puzzle. It's believed to be generated by a dynamo effect, where the motion of molten iron in the planet's core creates electric currents that generate a magnetic field. Mercury also possesses an extremely thin exosphere, a tenuous layer of gases surrounding the planet. This exosphere is composed of atoms that have been knocked off the surface by the solar wind, micrometeoroid impacts, and thermal desorption.</p>

            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <p>Our understanding of Mercury has been shaped by several key missions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Mariner 10 (1974-1975):</b> The first spacecraft to visit Mercury, providing initial images of its surface.</li>
                <li><b>MESSENGER (2011-2015):</b> A NASA mission that orbited Mercury, mapping its entire surface and revealing its composition.</li>
                <li><b>BepiColombo (Ongoing):</b> ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) currently has no dedicated mission to explore Mercury, the international BepiColombo mission, launched in 2018, is scheduled to enter orbit around Mercury in December 2025.
